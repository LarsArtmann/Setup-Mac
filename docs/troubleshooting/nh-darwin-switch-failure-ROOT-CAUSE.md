# nh darwin switch Failure - Root Cause Analysis & Solutions

**Date:** 2025-12-26
**nh Version:** 4.2.0
**Issue:** Temp directory access failure during sudo elevation

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The Problem

When running `nh darwin switch`, the tool follows this sequence:

1. **Build Phase (SUCCEEDS):**
   ```bash
   nix build '.#darwinConfigurations.Lars-MacBook-Air.config.system.build.toplevel'
   --out-link /var/folders/07/y9f_lh8s1zq2kr67_k94w22h0000gn/T/nh-osslW3wu/result
   ```
   - Creates temp symlink in user's per-user temp directory
   - Build completes successfully

2. **Elevation Phase (FAILS):**
   ```bash
   sudo env ... nix build --no-link --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system
   /var/folders/07/y9f_lh8s1zq2kr67_k94w22h0000gn/T/nh-osslW3wu/result
   ```
   - Elevates to root via sudo
   - Tries to access the temp symlink created as regular user
   - **FAILS**: `No such file or directory`

### Why This Happens

1. **macOS Temp Directory Structure:**
   - `/var/folders/{uid}/.../T/` = Per-user temp directories
   - Created with user-specific ownership and permissions
   - **NOT** accessible by other users, even root

2. **sudo Environment Behavior:**
   ```bash
   warning: $HOME ('/Users/larsartmann') is not owned by you,
   falling back to the one defined in the 'passwd' file ('/var/root')
   ```
   - sudo resets HOME to `/var/root` (root's home on macOS)
   - Changes user context from `larsartmann` to `root`
   - User temp directory becomes inaccessible

3. **macOS Security Model:**
   - macOS sandboxing prevents cross-user temp directory access
   - Root cannot access user temp directories created by regular users
   - This is a **security feature**, not a bug

4. **Temp Directory Cleanup:**
   - macOS may delete temp directories when elevated processes can't access them
   - Creates a race condition where the temp file disappears

### Why darwin-rebuild Works

`darwin-rebuild` handles this differently:
```bash
sudo darwin-rebuild switch --flake ./
```

- Uses system-wide temp directories or avoids temp files entirely
- Manages the build and activation process in a single privileged context
- No cross-user temp directory access required
- Official tool designed specifically for nix-darwin

## ✅ SOLUTIONS

### Solution #1: Use darwin-rebuild Directly (RECOMMENDED)

**Status:** ✅ Already implemented in justfile

```bash
# This already works perfectly
just switch
```

Which executes:
```bash
sudo /run/current-system/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake ./
```

**Advantages:**
- No temp directory issues
- Official tool for nix-darwin
- More reliable and predictable
- All features work (rollback, list, check, etc.)

**Disadvantages:**
- None significant

---

### Solution #2: Fix sudo Environment Variables

**Status:** ⚠️ May not fully solve the issue

Try running with environment variable preservation:

```bash
sudo -H -E /run/current-system/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake ./
```

**Flags:**
- `-H`: Set HOME environment variable to target user's home directory
- `-E`: Preserve the current user's environment variables

**Or modify justfile:**
```justfile
switch:
    @echo "🔄 Applying Nix configuration..."
    sudo -H -E /run/current-system/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake ./
    @echo "✅ Nix configuration applied"
```

**Testing:**
```bash
# Verify HOME is preserved
sudo -E sh -c 'echo HOME=$HOME'
# Should show: HOME=/Users/larsartmann
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- This solves the HOME directory issue but **may not** solve the temp directory access issue
- The underlying macOS temp directory security model still applies

---

### Solution #3: Use nh with Environment Variables

**Status:** ⚠️ May not fully solve the issue

```bash
export NH_PRESERVE_ENV=1
nh darwin switch .#darwinConfigurations.Lars-MacBook-Air
```

**Available Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Show activation logs for debugging
export NH_SHOW_ACTIVATION_LOGS=1

# Control environment variable preservation during elevation
export NH_PRESERVE_ENV=1

# Use a specific elevation program
export NH_ELEVATION_PROGRAM=sudo  # or doas, run0, pkexec
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- May help with some environment variable issues
- **Unlikely** to solve the core temp directory access problem
- The macOS temp directory security model is fundamental

---

### Solution #4: Use Alternative Deployment Tools

#### Option A: nixos-unified activate

```bash
# Add to flake.nix inputs:
inputs.nixos-unified.url = "github:srid/nixos-unified";

# Run:
nix run .#activate
```

**Advantages:**
- Lightweight alternative to deployment tools
- Simple `activate` command
- Avoids nh's temp directory issues

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires adding new flake input
- Less feature-rich than nh

#### Option B: deploy-rs

```bash
# Add to flake.nix inputs:
inputs.deploy-rs.url = "github:serokell/deploy-rs";

# Run:
deploy .#Lars-MacBook-Air
```

**Advantages:**
- Full-featured deployment tool
- Rollback support
- Works across NixOS and nix-darwin

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex setup
- May be overkill for single-system configuration

#### Option C: colmena

```bash
# Add to flake.nix inputs:
inputs.colmena.url = "github:zhaofengli/colmena";

# Run:
colmena apply --on Lars-MacBook-Air
```

**Advantages:**
- Hive-like deployment
- Good for multiple systems

**Disadvantages:**
- Designed for NixOS clusters
- May have nix-darwin limitations

---

### Solution #5: Manual Build and Activation

```bash
# Step 1: Build the system configuration
SYSTEM_PATH=$(nix build .#darwinConfigurations.Lars-MacBook-Air.system \
  --no-link --print-out-paths)

# Step 2: Set the system profile
sudo nix-env --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --set "$SYSTEM_PATH"

# Step 3: Run activation
sudo "$SYSTEM_PATH/activate"
```

**Advantages:**
- Shows each step explicitly
- Good for understanding the process
- Can debug individual steps

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex
- Requires multiple commands
- Not recommended for regular use

## 🔧 JUSTFILE ENHANCEMENTS

Here are useful additions for better control:

```justfile
# Build system without switching (good for testing)
build:
    @echo "🏗️  Building Nix configuration..."
    nix build .#darwinConfigurations.Lars-MacBook-Air.system --no-link --print-out-paths

# Build and show diff before switching
build-diff:
    @echo "🏗️  Building and showing diff..."
    nix build .#darwinConfigurations.Lars-MacBook-Air.system
    @echo "Comparing with current system:"
    nvd diff /run/current-system result

# List system profile generations
list-profile:
    @echo "📋 Listing system profile generations..."
    nix profile history --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system

# Show current system store path
show-current:
    @echo "Current system:"
    @readlink /run/current-system
    @echo "Profile:"
    @readlink /nix/var/nix/profiles/system

# Alternative switch with environment preservation
switch-preserve-env:
    @echo "🔄 Applying Nix configuration (with environment preservation)..."
    sudo -H -E /run/current-system/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake ./
    @echo "✅ Nix configuration applied"
```

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Immediate Use:

1. **Continue using `just switch`** - This is already working perfectly
2. **Ignore nh darwin switch failures** - This is a known macOS security issue
3. **Document the issue** - Use this file as reference for the future

### If You Must Use nh:

1. Try with `NH_PRESERVE_ENV=1`:
   ```bash
   export NH_PRESERVE_ENV=1
   nh darwin switch .#darwinConfigurations.Lars-MacBook-Air
   ```

2. If that fails, consider alternatives:
   - nixos-unified activate
   - deploy-rs
   - Continue using darwin-rebuild directly

### For Future Development:

1. Monitor nh releases for a fix to the temp directory issue
2. Consider contributing to nh if you have Rust expertise
3. The fix would involve using system-wide temp directories (/tmp) instead of per-user temp directories
