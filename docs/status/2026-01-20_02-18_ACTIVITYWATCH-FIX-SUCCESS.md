# ActivityWatch Fix - COMPLETE SUCCESS

**Date:** 2026-01-20 02:18 CET
**Status:** ✅ FULLY WORKING - All Issues Resolved
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours troubleshooting session
**Result:** 100% Success - ActivityWatch now tracking all programs correctly

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

ActivityWatch was not reporting programs due to **TWO critical issues**:
1. **Invalid LaunchAgent flag** - Using non-existent `--background` flag
2. **Database lock contention** - SQLite database locked, preventing writes

Both issues have been **completely resolved**:
- ✅ LaunchAgent fixed (`--background` → `--no-gui`)
- ✅ Database lock fixed (enabled WAL mode)
- ✅ All watchers working and tracking programs
- ✅ Database actively updating
- ✅ Web UI accessible and displaying events

---

## 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Invalid Command-Line Flag ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- LaunchAgent was using `--background` flag which doesn't exist in `aw-qt`
- Caused immediate startup failures
- Thousands of error logs: `Error: No such option: --background`

**Root Cause:**
- `aw-qt` command changed over time, removed `--background` option
- Valid flags: `--testing`, `--verbose`, `--no-gui`, `--interactive`

**Fix Applied:**
```nix
# File: platforms/darwin/services/launchagents.nix:26

# Before (WRONG)
<string>--background</string>

# After (CORRECT)
<string>--no-gui</string>
```

**Verification:**
```bash
just switch  # Applied Nix configuration
# Result: ✅ LaunchAgent updated successfully
```

---

### Issue #2: Database Lock Contention ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- SQLite database locked when multiple watchers tried to write simultaneously
- Error: `peewee.OperationalError: database is locked`
- Watchers connected but couldn't save data
- Web UI showed timeouts and "No events match selected criteria"

**Root Cause:**
- Multiple watchers (aw-watcher-window, aw-watcher-afk) writing concurrently
- SQLite default journal mode doesn't handle concurrent writes well
- Database locked, causing 500 errors and timeouts

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
# Enable Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/activitywatch/aw-server/peewee-sqlite.v2.db "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;"

# Result: ✅ WAL mode enabled
```

**Benefits of WAL Mode:**
- Multiple readers + single writer can access simultaneously
- Non-blocking writes
- Better performance
- Reduced lock contention

**Verification:**
```bash
# WAL files created
-rw-r--r-- 1 larsartmann staff 364M Jan 20 02:15 peewee-sqlite.v2.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 larsartmann staff  32K Jan 20 02:15 peewee-sqlite.v2.db-shm
-rw-r--r-- 1 larsartmann staff 524K Jan 20 02:16 peewee-sqlite.v2.db-wal
```

## 💡 Technical Learnings

### SQLite WAL Mode Benefits
1. **Concurrency:** Multiple readers + single writer
2. **Performance:** Faster reads/writes
3. **Reliability:** Less prone to corruption
4. **Lock Reduction:** Minimal lock contention

### ActivityWatch Architecture
1. **aw-qt:** Manager process (launches watchers)
2. **aw-server:** Flask API server (receives and stores events)
3. **aw-watcher-window:** Tracks window/app usage (Swift strategy)
4. **aw-watcher-afk:** Tracks keyboard/mouse idle time
5. **Communication:** HTTP API on port 5600
6. **Storage:** SQLite database with Peewee ORM

### macOS Permission Requirements
- **Accessibility:** Required for window watching
- **Screen Recording:** May be required for full functionality
- **Note:** Not blocking in this case (watchers are working)

## 🚀 Recommendations

### Immediate (Already Done) ✅
1. [x] Fix LaunchAgent flag issue
2. [x] Enable WAL mode on database
3. [x] Verify tracking works
4. [x] Confirm web UI displays events

### Future Improvements 📋

1. **Automate WAL Mode Setup**
   - Create script to enable WAL mode on first run
   - Add to LaunchAgent pre-start script
   - Prevent future lock issues

2. **Add Health Check Command**
   ```bash
   # Create: just activitywatch-health
   # Check: process status, port listening, database updating, API responding
   # Return: Detailed health report
   ```

3. **Implement Log Rotation**
   - Rotate stderr.log weekly
   - Keep last 7 days of logs
   - Archive older logs with gzip

4. **Add Monitoring Alerts**
   - Monitor for lock errors
   - Alert if watchers stop connecting
   - Notify if database not updating

5. **Create Test Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Create: just activitywatch-test
   # Test: program detection, AFK detection, API endpoints
   # Verify: database writes, web UI display
   ```

6. **Document WAL Mode Setup**
   - Add to troubleshooting guide
   - Include in AGENTS.md
   - Create dedicated WAL mode section
