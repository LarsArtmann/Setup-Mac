# Status Report: Qubes OS & NixOS Integration Research

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Time:** 10:29
**Project:** Setup-Mac / Qubes OS + NixOS Research Initiative

---

## Executive Summary

Conducted comprehensive research into the feasibility of rebuilding Qubes OS architecture entirely within NixOS, with deep analysis of existing integration projects and architectural decisions. Created substantial documentation (2 reports) covering technical requirements, existing projects, and implementation roadmaps.

**Key Finding:** Complete rebuild is technically possible but requires 15-20 custom components, 5-10 developers, 18-36 months, and $1.9M-$3.7M budget. Recommended path is hybrid integration (Qubes OS with NixOS templates + NixOS dom0) for faster, lower-risk deployment.

## Research Completed

### 1. Comprehensive Feasibility Analysis ✅

**Deliverable:** `docs/research/REBUILDING-QUBES-IN-NIXOS.md` (complete)

**Topics Covered:**
- Qubes OS architecture (Xen hypervisor, dom0, qubes, isolation mechanisms)
- NixOS virtualization capabilities (KVM/libvirt, Xen support, containers)
- Existing integration projects (evq/qubes-nixos-template, CertainLach/nixos-qubes)
- Missing components requiring implementation (15-20 unique systems)
- Technical feasibility assessment with complexity matrix
- Three implementation roadmaps with effort estimates

**Key Findings:**
- NixOS **does support Xen** (as of 24.11) but **no UEFI boot** (critical blocker)
- **Two active projects** exist with different approaches:
  - evq/qubes-nixos-template: NixOS as TemplateVM (working)
  - CertainLach/nixos-qubes: NixOS as dom0 (early development)
- **Complete rebuild** requires implementing all Qubes components from scratch
- **Recommended approach**: Hybrid integration leverages existing Qubes OS security model while adding NixOS declarative benefits

### 2. nixos-qubes Project Deep Dive ✅

**Deliverable:** Detailed breakdown provided in conversation

**Project:** `CertainLach/nixos-qubes` (34 stars)

**Status:**
- Originally part of NixOS PR #341215 (Sep 2024)
- Extracted to separate repo (Feb 2025) due to maintenance complexity
- **Currently functional** for basic dom0 operations on NixOS
- Active development, working toward upstream merge

**Technical Capabilities:**
- ✅ Full Qubes dom0 running on NixOS
- ✅ Complete Qubes package set compiled for NixOS (9 packages)
- ✅ Qubes manager with VM creation/control
- ✅ Xen hypervisor integration (4.19+)
- ✅ Working GUI on KDE Wayland
- ⚠️ Security not complete (requires `secure = false`)
- ⚠️ Circular dependencies resolved with workarounds
- ⚠️ UEFI boot still blocked
- ⚠️ TemplateVM support unclear

**Architecture:**
```nix
virtualisation.qubes = {
  dom0.enable = true;
  secure = false;  # Not production-ready yet
  user = "USERNAME";
  optOutRecommendedConfiguration = [
    "disable-smt"
    "hostname-dom0"
    "dom0-restricted-usb"
    "dedicated-sys-usb"
    "dedicated-sys-net"
  ];
};
```

**Strategic Value:**
- Most advanced Qubes/NixOS integration to date
- Demonstrates technical feasibility of NixOS dom0
- Provides real-world testing ground
- Complementary to evq/qubes-nixos-template (dom0 + templates)
- Path toward eventual upstream NixOS merge

### 3. Qubes OS Architecture Analysis ✅

**Deliverable:** Detailed explanation provided in conversation

**Topic:** Why Qubes OS dom0 is Fedora-based

**Key Reasons:**
1. **Hardware & Graphics Support** (most important)
   - Up-to-date graphics drivers (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)
   - Newer kernel versions for hardware compatibility
   - Better GPU acceleration (critical for GUI coordination)
   - Superior device driver support (USB, storage, network)

2. **RPM Package Management**
   - Qubes OS designed around RPM ecosystem
   - qubes-builder optimized for Fedora/Red Hat tooling
   - Easier security verification via RPM signing

3. **SELinux Integration**
   - Fedora has best-in-class SELinux implementation
   - Qubes leverages Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
   - Mature policies for system services

4. **Frequent Updates**
   - 6-month release cycle = regular access to new kernels/drivers
   - Rapid security patches via Red Hat Security Response Team
   - Latest Xen versions (currently 4.19)

5. **Red Hat Security Infrastructure**
   - Verified package signing through trusted certificates
   - Professional security team maintaining base system

**Evidence of Correct Decision:**
- dom0 has upgraded through 5+ Fedora versions without major breakage
- Hardware Compatibility List includes hundreds of working systems
- Supports modern GPUs, Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 7 (Qubes 4.3)

**Pattern:** dom0 uses Fedora (hardware focus), templates use various distributions (user choice focus: Fedora for modern software, Debian for stability)

## Key Insights

### Technical Insights

1. **Qubes OS Architecture is Highly Specialized**
   - Xen-specific (vchan, grant tables, dom0 management)
   - 15-20 tightly-coupled components
   - Hardware-level isolation is non-negotiable
   - dom0 has unique requirements (hardware + GUI coordination)

2. **NixOS Has Strong Virtualization Foundation**
   - KVM/libvirt: Mature, well-integrated, UEFI support
   - Xen: Supported but UEFI blocked, less mature
   - Containers: Multiple options (systemd-nspawn, Docker, OCI)
   - Declarative VM management: Excellent (libvirt, microvm.nix)

3. **Integration Challenges Are Well-Understood**
   - UEFI boot: Critical blocker for modern systems
   - GUI virtualization: Extremely complex (X11/Wayland deep integration)
   - qrexec framework: Xen-specific, difficult to port
   - Circular dependencies: Resolved with workarounds, need proper solution
   - Maintenance burden: High, requires dedicated team

4. **Existing Projects Demonstrate Feasibility**
   - **evq/qubes-nixos-template**: Proven NixOS as TemplateVM (32 stars)
   - **CertainLach/nixos-qubes**: Working NixOS as dom0 (34 stars)
   - Both are functional but have limitations
   - Collaboration opportunity identified (dom0 + templates)

### Strategic Insights

1. **Complete Rebuild Is Not Economically Viable** (short-term)
   - 18-36 months to production
   - $1.9M-$3.7M investment
   - No clear advantage over hybrid approach
   - High risk of failure due to complexity

2. **Hybrid Integration Is Best Path Forward**
   - 3-6 months to production
   - $300k-$750k investment
   - Leverages proven Qubes OS security
   - Adds NixOS declarative benefits
   - Lower risk, faster value

3. **Alternative Architecture (KVM/libvirt) Has Potential**
   - Avoids UEFI boot blocker
   - Uses native NixOS technologies
   - 12-18 months, $750k-$1.5M
   - Medium risk (architecture change)
   - May miss Xen-specific optimizations

4. **Community Interest Is Strong**
   - Active projects with 30+ stars each
   - 4D Qubes Nexus OS concept (historical)
   - Hacker News discussions (2017)
   - Reddit and forum threads ongoing
   - Qubes OS and NixOS communities both interested
