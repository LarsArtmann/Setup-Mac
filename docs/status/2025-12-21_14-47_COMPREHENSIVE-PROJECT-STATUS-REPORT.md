## ❓ G) #1 QUESTION I CANNOT FIGURE OUT MYSELF

### **"HOW DO WE VALIDATE THIS PERFECT CONFIGURATION ACTUALLY WORKS ON REAL HARDWARE?"**

**Specific Critical Unknowns:**

**Hardware Compatibility Validation:**
- ❌ **ZERO EVIDENCE** that evo-x2 configuration boots on actual Ryzen AI Max+ 395 hardware
- ❌ **NO VALIDATION** that Hyprland desktop functions properly on AMD GPU with ROCm
- ❌ **NO PERFORMANCE DATA** from real deployment scenarios vs theoretical projections
- ❌ **UNTESTED AUDIO SYSTEM** - Real audio codec compatibility and performance
- ❌ **UNKNOWN NETWORK PERFORMANCE** - Actual vs configured network optimization effectiveness

**User Experience Validation:**
- ❌ **NO REAL WORKFLOW TESTING** - Are keyboard shortcuts responsive under load?
- ❌ **UNKNOWN LAUNCH PERFORMANCE** - Application start times in production environment
- ❌ **UNTESTED MULTI-MONITOR BEHAVIOR** - Workspace management on real displays
- ❌ **NO TOUCH/GESTURE VALIDATION** - Input device performance and accuracy
- ❌ **UNKNOWN BATTERY IMPACT** - Power management effectiveness on mobile hardware

**Integration Uncertainties:**
- ❌ **UNVERIFIED GPU ACCELERATION** - Does ROCm actually provide performance benefits?
- ❌ **UNTESTED CONTAINER PERFORMANCE** - Docker/Kubernetes isolation and efficiency
- ❌ **UNKNOWN AI/ML PIPELINE PERFORMANCE** - Real ML model training and inference speed
- ❌ **NO MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS** - Are alerts and dashboards actually useful?

**What I Cannot Determine From Code Analysis:**
- How does the system perform under real development workloads?
- What's the actual user experience vs theoretical perfection?
- Are there hardware-specific edge cases not covered in configuration?
- What's the real-world reliability and stability under continuous usage?
