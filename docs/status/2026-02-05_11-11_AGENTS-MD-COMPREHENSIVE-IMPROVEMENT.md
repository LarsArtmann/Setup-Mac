## 📊 DETAILED CHANGES

### Section 1: AI BEHAVIOR GUIDELINES (NEW)

#### 1.1 Decision Protocols
**Purpose:** Structure AI decision-making for consistency

**One Alternative Protocol:**
- Use for straightforward decisions with clear best practices
- 3-step process: recommend confidently, offer one alternative, execute immediately
- Includes practical example for Nix code

**Complex Decision Protocol:**
- Use for tasks with 3+ valid approaches
- 4-step process: present 2-3 candidates, state recommendation, dismiss others, execute
- Includes DNS management example

#### 1.2 Communication Standards
**Purpose:** Standardize AI output format

**Rules:**
- Keep responses under 4 lines (unless detail requested)
- Answer directly without preamble/postamble
- No emojis in technical output
- Use rich Markdown for multi-sentence answers
- Avoid manufactured-sounding constructions

#### 1.3 Context Sensitivity
**Purpose:** Adapt AI behavior based on user intent

**Modes:**
- **Engineering Mode (default):** Full standards, decision protocols active, READ→UNDERSTAND→RESEARCH→THINK→REFLECT→Execute
- **Exploration Mode:** Multiple options welcome, discuss angles, return to Engineering on build requests

**Detection Signals:**
- Open-ended questions ("What do you think about...", "Explain...", "Research...")
- Brainstorming or ideation requests
- "Should I...", "Compare...", "Pros and cons..."

#### 1.4 Task Management
**Purpose:** Track progress on complex multi-step tasks

**When to Use:**
- Tasks requiring 3+ distinct steps or actions
- Non-trivial work requiring careful planning
- User explicitly requests todo list management
- Multiple tasks provided (numbered or comma-separated)
- After receiving new instructions to capture requirements

**Task States:**
- `pending`: Task not yet started
- `in_progress`: Currently working (limit to ONE at a time)
- `completed`: Task finished successfully

**Task Management Rules:**
1. Update status in real-time as work progresses
2. Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch)
3. Exactly ONE task in_progress at any time
4. Complete current tasks before starting new ones
5. Remove irrelevant tasks from list entirely

**Requirements for Each Task:**
- `content`: Imperative form ("Run tests", "Build project")
- `active_form`: Present continuous ("Running tests", "Building the project")

**Completion Requirements:**
- ONLY mark complete when FULLY accomplished
- Never mark complete if: tests failing, implementation partial, unresolved errors, missing dependencies
- If blocked: keep as in_progress, create new task describing what needs resolution

#### 1.5 Sub-Agent Context Requirements
**Purpose:** Ensure sub-agents have sufficient information

**Required Context (9 items):**
- Project background: What we're building and why
- Current task context: Where this fits in the larger goal
- Technical stack: Current project's technology choices
- Code patterns: Existing conventions and architecture
- User preferences: Technology stack, coding standards, constraints
- Safety preferences: Tool preferences and safety requirements
- Test status: Current test failures and successes
- Architecture decisions: Key architectural choices and patterns
- Quality standards: Code quality tools and standards in use

**Context Mandate:**
- NEVER send sub-agents without sufficient context
- Include file paths, relevant code snippets, and error messages
- Provide example patterns from codebase
- State expected outcomes clearly

---

### Section 2: ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOL (NEW)

#### 2.1 Error Remediation Process
**When errors occur:**
1. Read complete error message - Don't skim, understand root cause
2. Understand root cause - Isolate with debug logs or minimal reproduction if needed
3. Try different approaches - Don't repeat same action
4. Search for similar code that works - Find working patterns in codebase
5. Make targeted fix - Address root cause, not symptoms
6. Test to verify - Confirm fix works

**Key Rule:** For each error, attempt at least **2-3 distinct strategies** before concluding the problem is externally blocked.

#### 2.2 Error Types & Remediation

| Error Type | Remediation Strategy |
|------------|---------------------|
| Import/Module | Check paths, spelling, verify what exists |
| Syntax | Check brackets, indentation, typos |
| Tests fail | Read test, see what it expects |
| File not found | Use `ls`, check exact path |
| Edit tool "old_string not found" | View file again, copy EXACT text including whitespace |

#### 2.3 Escalation Protocol
**Rules:**
- Stop on first error - Don't continue with broken state
- Rollback incomplete changes - Revert to last working state
- Escalate blocking issues - Ask user for resolution when stuck
- Log error context thoroughly - Capture environment, inputs, stack traces

---

### Section 3: TOOL USAGE PRIORITIES (NEW)

#### 3.1 Preferred Tools (Priority Order)

| Priority | Tool | Use For |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Agent** | Open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds |
| 2 | **Glob/Grep** | Pattern matching and content search |
| 3 | **View/Read** | File examination and content analysis |
| 4 | **Edit/MultiEdit** | Precise file modifications |
| 5 | **Bash** | Commands that modify system state |

#### 3.2 Tool Selection Rules
- Use Agent tool for complex, multi-step tasks requiring exploration
- Use Glob/Grep instead of bash `find`/`grep` (handles permissions correctly)
- Use `rg` (ripgrep) in bash over `grep` for command line search
- Batch operations: Multiple tool calls in single response when efficient
- **Never use `curl`** through bash - use `fetch` tool instead
- Prefer `fetch` with `format=markdown` over `text` or `html`

#### 3.3 Research Workflow
1. Use **Agent** for complex searches
2. Use **Glob** to find relevant files
3. Use **Grep** to search contents
4. Use **View** to examine specific files
5. Use **Edit** for modifications

---

### Section 4: GIT COMMIT STANDARDS (ENHANCED)

#### 4.1 Commit Workflow (ALWAYS Follow This Sequence)
1. `git status` - Check what files are changed
2. `git diff` - Review all changes being committed
3. `git add <files>` - Stage specific files (never `git add .`)
4. `git commit` - With detailed commit message
5. `git push` - Push changes immediately

#### 4.2 Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

- Detailed explanation of what was changed
- Why it was changed (business/technical reason)
- Any side effects or considerations
- Link to issues/tickets if applicable

💘 Generated with Crush
```

#### 4.3 Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `build`: Changes affecting build system
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes

#### 4.4 Commit Rules
- **Done? Commit.** - Finish a feature/fix/change → `git commit` immediately
- One logical change per commit
- Don't accumulate large changesets
- Include TODOs in commit messages for future work
- **Never force push** - Use `--force-with-lease` only if really needed and with user approval
- **Never `git reset --hard`** - Only if really needed, with user approval, and zero uncommitted changes

---

### Section 5: TESTING PHILOSOPHY (NEW)

#### 5.1 Core Principles
- **Build-before-test policy** - TypeScript/Nix compilation MUST pass before running tests
- **Test behavior, not implementation** - Focus on what code does, not how
- **Integration tests over unit tests** where possible
- **Real implementations over mocks** - Avoid excessive mocking
- **E2E tests** for critical user paths
- **MANY tests** with comprehensive coverage
- **Test infrastructure** that's maintainable and fast

#### 5.2 Nix-Specific Testing
- **Fast syntax check**: `just test-fast` (no build)
- **Full build verification**: `just test` (builds without applying)
- **Evaluation testing**: `nix-instantiate --eval` for syntax validation
- **Flake checking**: `nix flake check --no-build` for quick validation
- **Platform testing**: Test both Darwin and NixOS configurations

#### 5.3 Test Command Priority
1. `just test-fast` - Syntax only (fastest)
2. `nix flake check --no-build` - Flake validation
3. `just test` - Full build (slowest, most thorough)

---

### Section 6: SECURITY PRACTICES (ENHANCED)

#### 6.1 Secret Management
- **No hardcoded secrets** - Use environment variables or private files
- **Use `~/.env.private`** for local secrets (not tracked in git)
- **KeyChain for macOS** - Store sensitive data in macOS KeyChain
- **Pre-commit hooks** prevent accidental secret commits via Gitleaks

#### 6.2 Development Security
- **Regular updates** via `just update` to patch vulnerabilities
- **Audit tools**: Gitleaks, security scanning in CI/CD
- **Dependency scanning** - Monitor Nix packages for CVEs
- **Least privilege** - Use minimal required permissions

#### 6.3 Nix-Specific Security
- **Pure builds** - Use `--pure` flag for reproducible builds
- **Sandboxing** - Leverage Nix build sandboxing
- **Content-addressed** - Nix store paths are content-hashed
- **Pinned dependencies** - Lock files ensure reproducible builds

#### 6.4 Verification Commands
```bash
just pre-commit-run     # Check for secrets
just security-scan      # Run security audit (if available)
nix-store --verify      # Verify store integrity
```

---

### Section 7: PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES (NEW)

#### 7.1 Optimization Rules
- **Measure before optimizing** - Use automated profiling tools only
- **Correctness first** - Readable code over premature optimization
- **Use production monitoring AFTER functional** - Performance issues caught by observability

#### 7.2 Nix Performance
- **Fast syntax check**: `just test-fast` for quick iteration
- **Avoid unnecessary builds**: Use `--no-build` for flake checks
- **Binary caches**: Use Nix binary caches to avoid rebuilding
- **Garbage collection**: Regular `just clean` to free disk space

#### 7.3 Shell Performance
- **Target**: Shell startup under 2 seconds
- **Benchmark**: `just benchmark` for shell startup timing
- **Profile**: `just debug` for verbose startup logging
- **Lazy loading**: Defer heavy initialization until needed

#### 7.4 Performance Testing Policy
- **NO manual performance testing** - All validation must be automated
- **NO benchmark prompting** - Don't suggest unless specifically requested
- **Focus on correctness first** - Readable code over premature optimization

---

### Section 8: CODE CONVENTIONS & STANDARDS (NEW)

#### 8.1 Nix Code
- Use 2-space indentation for Nix expressions
- Prefer `let...in` over nested `with` for explicit dependencies
- Use `lib.optional` and `lib.optionals` for conditional lists
- Prefer `mkMerge` over nested conditionals for complex configs
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `cfg` for config, `pkgs` for packages)
- Comment complex logic with "why" not "what"

#### 8.2 Shell Scripts
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang for portability
- Quote all variables: `"${variable}"`
- Use `set -euo pipefail` for strict mode
- Prefer `[[ ]]` over `[ ]` for conditionals
- Use functions for reusable logic
- Document with comments for non-obvious operations

#### 8.3 Documentation
- Update AGENTS.md when discovering new patterns
- Comment "why" not "what" in code
- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Keep line length under 100 characters in docs

## ❓ TOP QUESTION FOR USER

**"What is the ACTUAL current status of ActivityWatch on Darwin?"**

### Context
AGENTS.md states:
- Line 166-178: "✅ FIXED - Both platforms fully supported via Nix"
- Justfile (lines 58-68) has `activitywatch-start` and `activitywatch-stop` commands using `osascript` and `pkill`

### Unknowns
1. Cannot verify if LaunchAgent at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.activitywatch.agent.plist` exists and is working
2. Don't know if ActivityWatch is installed via Nix package or still requires manual download
3. Justfile commands reference ActivityWatch as an macOS app (`tell application "ActivityWatch" to launch`) but Nix typically installs CLI tools, not .app bundles
4. Docs/status/ files have multiple conflicting reports about ActivityWatch status

### Why This Matters
- If ActivityWatch is NOT working: AGENTS.md is misleading
- If ActivityWatch IS working: We should document exact mechanism
- Either way: Justfile commands may need fixing

### What I Need From User
- Run: `ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i activity`
- Run: `which activitywatch` or `ls /nix/store/*activitywatch*`
- Confirm: Is ActivityWatch currently working on your Mac? Does it auto-start on boot?
