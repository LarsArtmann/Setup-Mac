# 📊 COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT STATUS UPDATE

**Time:** 2025-12-06 02:23
**Phase:** Phase 1 (Architecture Consolidation) - **COMPLETED**

---

### a) ✅ FULLY DONE
1.  **Architecture Consolidation:**
    *   Unified `flake.nix` handles both macOS (`Lars-MacBook-Air`) and NixOS (`evo-x2`).
    *   **Unified Home Manager:** Implemented a 3-tier structure:
        *   `dotfiles/common/home.nix`: Shared packages & config (Git, Shells, CLI tools).
        *   `dotfiles/nix/home.nix`: macOS specific overrides (Apps, keybindings).
        *   `dotfiles/nixos/home.nix`: NixOS specific overrides (Wayland, XDG).
    *   **Ghost Systems Integration:** All complex `specialArgs` (`TypeAssertions`, `State`, etc.) are correctly passed to Home Manager on both platforms.

2.  **Platform Conflict Resolution:**
    *   Removed `helium` (macOS-only) from shared packages to fix NixOS build failures.
    *   Fixed deprecation warnings for `services.xserver.displayManager` on NixOS.

3.  **Verification:**
    *   `nix flake check` passes for both `darwinConfigurations` and `nixosConfigurations`.
    *   `crush` package evaluates correctly.

### b) 🚧 PARTIALLY DONE
1.  **Hardware Support (EVO-X2):**
    *   Core config exists, but specific drivers for WiFi 7 (`mt7925`) and 2.5G Ethernet (`rtl8125bg`) need explicit kernel module configuration.
2.  **Shell Performance:**
    *   Shells are configured in `common`, but specific performance tuning (lazy loading) needs verification on the new NixOS structure.

### c) ❌ NOT STARTED
1.  **Physical Deployment:** The config has verified *validity*, but has not yet been applied to the physical EVO-X2 hardware.
2.  **Secret Management:** No `sops-nix` or `age` integration yet for managing SSH keys/tokens across the two systems.
3.  **Cross-Platform Abstraction Layer:** We implemented the *structure* (common/home.nix), but the explicit `core/Platform.nix` helper library is not yet fully utilized/implemented.

### d) 💀 TOTALLY FUCKED UP / RISKS
*   **None currently.** The "split brain" risk has been resolved by the unified Home Manager architecture.
*   **Minor Risk:** The "Ghost Systems" files (`BehaviorDrivenTests.nix`, etc.) still have syntax errors found by `deadnix`. They are harmless now (unused), but represent technical debt.

### e) 💡 WHAT WE SHOULD IMPROVE
1.  **Extract Hardware Modules:** Move EVO-X2 specific hardware config from `configuration.nix` to a dedicated `platforms/nixos/hardware/evo-x2.nix` module for cleaner separation.
2.  **Automate Deployment:** Create a `just deploy-nixos` command that handles remote building/switching if the machines are networked.

### f) 🔥 TOP #25 THINGS WE SHOULD GET DONE NEXT

**IMMEDIATE (Deployment Prep)**
1.  [ ] **Add `mt7925e` module:** Ensure WiFi 7 driver is loaded in `hardware-configuration.nix`.
2.  [ ] **Add `r8125` module:** Ensure 2.5G Ethernet driver is loaded.
3.  [ ] **Commit All Changes:** Ensure git state is clean before deployment.
4.  [ ] **Update README:** Document the new 3-tier Home Manager structure.
5.  [ ] **Backup Current Mac State:** Run `just backup` before next switch.

**HIGH PRIORITY (Post-Deployment)**
6.  [ ] **Flash NixOS:** Actually install on the EVO-X2.
7.  [ ] **Verify Audio:** Check Pipewire functionality on EVO-X2.
8.  [ ] **Verify GPU:** Check `radeontop` or `rocm-smi` on EVO-X2.
9.  [ ] **Sync Secrets:** Set up SSH keys on NixOS to match Mac (or authorize Mac).
10. [ ] **Benchmark Shell:** Run `hyperfine` on NixOS to compare with Mac M2.

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Refinement)**
11. [ ] **Fix Ghost Systems Syntax:** Repair the broken `.nix` files found by `deadnix`.
12. [ ] **Implement `Platform.nix`:** Finish the abstraction helper.
13. [ ] **Unified `justfile`:** Ensure `just` commands work identically on Linux.
14. [ ] **Theme Consistency:** Ensure `starship` and `fish` look identical on both.
15. [ ] **Container Setup:** Configure Docker/Podman on NixOS (it's already enabled in config).
