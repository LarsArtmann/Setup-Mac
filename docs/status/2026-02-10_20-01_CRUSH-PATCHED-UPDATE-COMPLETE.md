# Crush-Patched Update - February 10, 2026

## Summary

Successfully updated `crush-patched` from v0.39.3 to v0.41.0 with three critical patches applied.

## Changes Made

### Package Version Update
- **Old Version:** v0.39.3
- **New Version:** v0.41.0
- **Release Date:** February 9, 2026

### Patches Applied

Three critical patches were applied from upstream Crush PRs to fix bugs and improve stability:

#### 1. PR #2181 - SQLite Busy Timeout Fix
- **Issue:** #2129 - SQLite deadlocks under high concurrency
- **Root Cause:** 5-second timeout too short for multi-instance usage
- **Fix:** Increase timeout to 30s, consolidate pragma configuration
- **Files Modified:**
  - `internal/db/connect.go`
  - `internal/db/connect_modernc.go`
  - `internal/db/connect_ncruces.go`
- **Impact:** Eliminates database lockups when using multiple Crush instances

#### 2. PR #2180 - LSP Files Outside CWD Fix
- **Issue:** #1401 - LSP client can't handle files outside working directory
- **Root Cause:** Internal `os.Getwd()` calls instead of explicit working directory
- **Fix:** Make LSP client receive working directory explicitly
- **Files Modified:**
  - `internal/lsp/client.go`
  - `internal/lsp/client_test.go`
  - `internal/lsp/manager.go`
- **Impact:** Improved reliability of IDE/editor integration

#### 3. PR #2161 - Regex Cache Memory Leak Fix
- **Issue:** Regex caches grow unbounded across sessions
- **Root Cause:** No cache clearing at session boundaries
- **Fix:** Clear regex caches when starting new sessions
- **Files Modified:**
  - `internal/agent/tools/grep.go`
  - `internal/ui/model/ui.go`
- **Impact:** Prevents memory leaks during long-running sessions

## Technical Implementation

### Package Changes
- **File Modified:** `pkgs/crush-patched.nix`
- **Source Hash:** Updated for v0.41.0 tarball
- **Vendor Hash:** `sha256-2rEerdtwNAhQbdqabyyetw30DSpbmIxoiU2YPTWbEcg=`
- **Patch Method:** Using `pkgs.fetchpatch` to download patches from GitHub

### Patch Management
- **Approach:** Patches fetched directly from GitHub commit URLs via `pkgs.fetchpatch`
- **Hashes:** All patches verified with SHA256 hashes from `nix-prefetch-url`
- **Advantages:**
  - Reproducible builds (patches fetched from immutable GitHub URLs)
  - No local patch file dependencies
  - Easy to add/remove patches
  - Automatic hash verification

### Build Results
- **Build Time:** ~2.5 minutes
- **Binary Size:** 58.3 MB (after stripping)
- **Go Version:** 1.26rc3
- **Platform:** aarch64-darwin

### Build Verification

All three patches were successfully applied:

## Documentation Updates

### Files Updated
- **`pkgs/README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation of:
  - Applied patches with detailed explanations
  - Update procedures for future versions
  - Patch management instructions
  - Verification commands

### Documentation Structure
1. **Overview** - Version info and last update date
2. **Applied Patches** - Detailed descriptions of each patch
3. **Update to New Version** - Step-by-step update guide
4. **Patch Management** - How to add/remove patches
5. **Verification** - Commands to verify patches are applied

## Build Process

### Initial Issues
1. **Disk Space:** Initial build failed with "no space left on device" (96% full)
   - **Solution:** Ran `just clean` to free up Nix cache space
   - **Result:** Freed ~13GB, reducing usage to 91%

2. **Patch Path Issues:** Local patch files not accessible in Nix sandbox
   - **Solution:** Switched to `pkgs.fetchpatch` with GitHub URLs
   - **Result:** Reproducible builds with verified patch hashes

### Final Build
- **Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
- **Command:** `nix build .#crush-patched`
- **Output:** `/nix/store/5pzb0p7mqybgbn29pmnif3f0dggyii2r-crush-patched-v0.41.0`
- **Binary:** Verified working with `--version` output showing "v0.41.0"

## Next Steps

### Installation
To install the updated package:
```bash
nix build .#crush-patched
just switch
```

### Future Updates
To update to future versions:
1. Check Crush GitHub releases for new version
2. Update `version` and source `sha256` in `pkgs/crush-patched.nix`
3. Update `vendorHash` with fake hash to trigger error
4. Build and copy correct hash from error message
5. Update `vendorHash` with correct hash
6. Rebuild and install

### Patch Management
To add new patches:
1. Find PR/commit in Crush repository
2. Get patch hash with `nix-prefetch-url`
3. Add to `patches` list in `pkgs/crush-patched.nix`
4. Rebuild

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Checklist
- [x] Version updated to latest (v0.41.0)
- [x] Source hash updated correctly
- [x] Vendor hash computed and set
- [x] All three patches applied successfully
- [x] Binary builds without errors
- [x] Binary runs correctly (version check passes)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Package accessible via flake (`.#crush-patched`)

### Testing Results
- **Build:** ✅ Successful in 2m 37s
- **Patches:** ✅ All 3 patches applied (8 files modified)
- **Binary:** ✅ Runs correctly, shows v0.41.0
- **Integration:** ✅ Package accessible via flake
- **Documentation:** ✅ Complete and accurate

## Repository Status

### Modified Files
- `pkgs/crush-patched.nix` - Main package definition
- `pkgs/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Unchanged Files (Legacy)
- `patches/2181-sqlite-busy-timeout.patch` - Local patch (no longer used)
- `patches/2180-lsp-files-outside-cwd.patch` - Local patch (no longer used)
- `patches/2161-regex-cache-reset.patch` - Local patch (no longer used)

**Note:** Local patch files are retained in the repository but no longer used. Patches are now fetched directly from GitHub via `pkgs.fetchpatch`.

## Lessons Learned

### Patch Management Best Practices
- **Use `pkgs.fetchpatch`:** More reproducible than local files
- **Fetch from GitHub:** Immutable URLs with guaranteed availability
- **Verify hashes:** Always use `nix-prefetch-url` to get correct hashes

### Build Optimization
- **Clean Nix cache:** Essential before large builds to avoid disk space issues
- **Fake hash method:** Using `00000...` hash triggers helpful error with correct hash
- **Verification:** Always run `--version` after build to confirm binary works
