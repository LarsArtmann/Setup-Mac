# Fish Shell Performance Issue - Critical Finding

## Summary
**CRITICAL:** Fish shell is performing 20x slower than expected and slower than ZSH.

## Benchmark Results
- **Fish:** 1458ms (expected: 10.73ms)
- **ZSH:** 72ms (current default)
- **Bash:** 26ms

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Fish without config:** 16ms (excellent)
2. **Fish with minimal config:** 701ms (still slow)
3. **Fish with full config:** 1458ms (very slow)

## Issue Details
- Fish performance regression from expected 10.73ms to 1458ms
- Even minimal Fish config causes 700ms+ startup time
- Issue appears to be system-level, not configuration-level
- ZSH is currently 20x faster than Fish

## Recommendation
**KEEP ZSH AS DEFAULT** until Fish performance issue is resolved.
- ZSH: 72ms startup (acceptable performance)
- Fish: 1458ms startup (unacceptable)

## Investigation Needed
1. Check Fish compilation/installation issues
2. Verify Fish dependencies
3. Test different Fish versions
4. Check system compatibility

## Previous Session Claims
The documentation claimed Fish achieved 10.73ms performance, but current testing shows 1458ms. This suggests either:
1. System configuration changed
2. Fish installation is broken
3. Previous measurements were incorrect
4. Environment differences

## Action Required
Do NOT activate Fish shell until performance issue is resolved.
