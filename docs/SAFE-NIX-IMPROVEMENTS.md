---

## 🔒 SECURITY HARDENING

### 1. SSH Banner File Missing Validation
**Priority:** HIGH
**File:** `platforms/nixos/services/ssh.nix:60`

**Current State:**
```nix
environment.etc."ssh/banner".source = ../users/ssh-banner;
```

**Issue:**
- Relative path won't resolve correctly from NixOS config location
- Path may not exist, causing build failures
- No validation that banner file is present

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
environment.etc."ssh/banner".text = ''
  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY - All activity logged ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝
'';
```

**Justification:**
- Inline text guarantees banner exists
- No file system dependencies
- Build-time guaranteed success

---

### 2. Hardcoded SSH Key Exposed
**Priority:** HIGH
**File:** `platforms/nixos/system/configuration.nix:39-42`

**Current State:**
```nix
users.users.lars.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [
  "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI..."
];
```

**Issue:**
- SSH public key hardcoded in version control
- Security best practice to keep keys out of git
- Harder to rotate keys

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = lib.optionalString (builtins.pathExists ./ssh-keys/lars.pub)
  (builtins.readFile ./ssh-keys/lars.pub);
```

**Justification:**
- Keys stored in external file (not committed)
- File won't be tracked by git with proper .gitignore
- Easier key rotation

**Additional Steps:**
1. Create `ssh-keys/` directory
2. Add `ssh-keys/*.pub` to `.gitignore`
3. Move key to `ssh-keys/lars.pub`

---

### 3. Enable Nix Sandbox on Darwin
**Priority:** HIGH
**File:** `platforms/darwin/nix/settings.nix:21`

**Current State:**
```nix
sandbox = false; # OVERRIDE: Disabled to match generation 205 working state
```

**Issue:**
- Sandbox disabled is security risk
- Comment suggests temporary workaround
- No documentation of why it's needed

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
sandbox = true;
sandbox-fallback = false;
```

**Alternative (if truly needed):**
```nix
sandbox = false;
# Disabled due to build failures with certain packages on macOS
# See issue tracking in docs/troubleshooting/
# Consider re-enabling with: sandbox-fallback = true;
```

**Justification:**
- Sandbox provides build isolation and security
- If truly needed, should document why permanently
- Consider using sandbox exceptions instead of full disable

---

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### 4. Excessive Tmux History
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**File:** `platforms/common/programs/tmux.nix:10`

**Current State:**
```nix
historyLimit = 100000;
```

**Issue:**
- 100k history lines consume unnecessary memory
- No practical benefit over smaller limit
- Slower tmux startup/scrollback

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
historyLimit = 10000;
```

**Justification:**
- 10k is more than sufficient for practical use
- Reduces memory consumption
- Faster tmux operations

---

### 5. Suboptimal Filesystem Mount Options
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**File:** `platforms/nixos/hardware/hardware-configuration.nix:31`

**Current State:**
```nix
options = ["subvol=@" "compress=zstd" "noatime"];
```

**Issue:**
- Compression level not specified (defaults to 3)
- Missing space_cache=v2 for metadata handling
- Could be optimized for workload

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
options = ["subvol=@" "compress=zstd:3" "noatime" "space_cache=v2"];
```

**Justification:**
- Explicit compression level (zstd:3) balances performance/ratio
- space_cache=v2 improves metadata handling
- Better documentation of settings

---

### 6. Hyprland Blur Can Be Further Optimized
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**File:** `platforms/nixos/desktop/hyprland.nix:90-101`

**Current State:**
```nix
blur = {
  enabled = true;
  size = 2;
  passes = 1;
  noise = 0.0117;
  contrast = 0.8916;
  brightness = 0.8172;
  ignore_opacity = true;
  new_optimizations = true;
  xray = true;
};
```

**Issue:**
- Blurs popups and overlays (unnecessary GPU work)
- Can disable for better performance
- No impact on desktop aesthetics

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
blur = {
  enabled = true;
  size = 2;
  passes = 1;
  noise = 0.0117;
  contrast = 0.8916;
  brightness = 0.8172;
  ignore_opacity = true;
  new_optimizations = true;
  xray = true;
  popups = false;  # Don't blur popups - better performance
  overlay = false;  # Don't blur overlay - better performance
};
```

**Justification:**
- Disabling blur on popups/overlays improves GPU performance
- No visual impact on desktop aesthetics
- Reduces GPU load

**Current State:**
```nix
# {config, pkgs, lib, ...}:
# imports = [
#   ../../common/core/nix-settings.nix
# ];

# Then duplicates all settings locally...
```

**Issue:**
- Imports commented out, duplicates all settings
- Code duplication creates maintenance burden
- Changes must be made in multiple places

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
{config, pkgs, lib, ...}:
{
  imports = [../../common/core/nix-settings.nix];

  nix.settings = {
    # Only override Darwin-specific settings
    sandbox = false;  # Document why this is needed
  };
}
```

**Justification:**

```nix
programs.fish.interactiveShellInit = lib.mkMerge [
  (lib.mkIf pkgs.stdenv.isDarwin ''
    # Homebrew integration
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
    # Carapace completions
    ${pkgs.carapace}/bin/carapace _carapace|source
  '')
  (lib.mkIf pkgs.stdenv.isLinux ''
    # Linux-specific init
  '')
];
```

**Justification:**
- Code duplication violates DRY principle
- Changes must be made in multiple places
- Platform-specific logic can be handled with guards

---

- Complex type system not documented

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
# Types.nix - TYPE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
# =====================================
# Provides strong type safety for all configuration components
#
# Core Types:
#   - PackageType: Valid package definitions
#   - ConfigType: Configuration file structures
#   - ServiceType: Service configuration schemas
#
# Usage:
#   Import into modules that need type validation:
#     { config, lib, types, ... }:
#     let
#       inherit (import ./core/Types.nix { inherit lib; }) PackageType;
#     in ...
#
# Type Safety:
#   - Compile-time validation prevents runtime errors
#   - Assertion framework catches configuration errors
#   - Strong typing eliminates inconsistencies
```

```

**Issue:**
- Minimal explanation of override
- No tracking of issue

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
sandbox = false;
# OVERRIDE: Disabled due to build failures with certain packages on macOS
# Generation 205 had sandbox disabled, re-enabling caused failures
# See: docs/troubleshooting/sandbox-issues.md (create if not exists)
# Consider re-enabling with: sandbox-fallback = true;
# Or use sandbox exceptions for problematic packages only
```

**Justification:**
- Better documentation prevents accidental reversion
- Tracks technical debt
- Provides context for future resolution

---

### 21. Document SSH Banner Purpose
**Priority:** LOW
**File:** `platforms/nixos/services/ssh.nix:51-52`

**Current State:**
```nix
Banner = "/etc/ssh/banner";
```

**Issue:**
- Banner enabled but purpose not documented
- No explanation of legal/security importance

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
# Login banner for legal compliance and security awareness
# Displayed before authentication - informs users of monitoring

fileSystems."/" = {
  device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/0b629b65-a1b7-40df-a7dc-9ea5e0b04959";
  fsType = "btrfs";
};
```

**Issue:**
- Hardcoded disk UUIDs without validation
- No fail-fast if hardware changes

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
assertions = [
  {
    assertion = lib.pathExists "/dev/disk/by-uuid/0b629b65-a1b7-40df-a7dc-9ea5e0b04959";
    message = "Root filesystem UUID not found - check hardware-configuration.nix";
  }
];
```

    paths.home
    paths.config
    # Some paths may be optional
  ];
```

**Issue:**
- Validation allows current user fallback
- Too permissive

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
validatePathConfig = paths:
  lib.all (path: lib.pathExists path) [
    paths.home
    paths.config
    # Only validate dotfiles paths if they're absolute
  ] && lib.all (path: lib.hasPrefix "/Users/" path) [
    paths.home
    paths.config
  ];
```

**Justification:**
- Current validation is too permissive
- Better to fail explicitly

  (wrapper ? configFiles && wrapper.configFiles != null)
  "Wrapper ${name}: configFiles must be defined"
```

**Issue:**
- Assertion fails for wrappers that don't use config files
- Not all wrappers need configFiles

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
lib.assertMsg
  (!wrapper ? configFiles || (wrapper.configFiles != null))
  "Wrapper ${name}: configFiles must be defined or not present"
```

**Justification:**
- Current assertion fails for wrappers that don't use config files
- Makes assertion optional
- More flexible

---

### 25. Add System Package Type Assertion
**Priority:** LOW
**File:** `platforms/nixos/system/configuration.nix:44-46`

**Current State:**
```nix
users.users.lars.packages = with pkgs; [
  vim
  htop
];
```

- Invalid packages won't be caught early

**Suggested Fix:**
```nix
users.users.lars.packages = lib.mkOption {
  type = lib.types.listOf lib.types.package;
  default = [];
  description = "User-specific packages";
};
```

**Justification:**
- Ensures only valid packages can be added to user profile
- Early error detection
- Better type safety
