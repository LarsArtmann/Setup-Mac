| Configuration | Simple | More complex |

| Stability | Excellent | Good |

## Recommendation: Keep hyprpaper

### Reasons to Keep hyprpaper:
1. **Already installed** - No additional work needed
2. **Lower overhead** - Better for system performance
3. **Official integration** - More stable with Hyprland updates
4. **Simpler** - Less configuration complexity
5. **AMD GPU optimized** - Works efficiently with AMD hardware

### When to Consider swww:
- You want animated wallpapers or GIFs
- You need smooth transitions between wallpapers
- You want to cycle through multiple wallpapers automatically
- You need per-monitor different wallpapers with different behaviors

## How to Switch to swww (if needed in future)

If you later decide to switch to swww for animations:

```nix
# Replace hyprpaper with swww in hyprland.nix
home.packages = with pkgs; [
  # ... (other packages)
  swww  # Instead of hyprpaper
];
```

Then configure in Hyprland:
```ini
# In hyprland.conf
exec-once = swww init
exec-once = swww img ~/.config/wallpaper.png
```

## Current Configuration
Your current setup uses hyprpaper correctly with wallpaper management. This is the recommended approach for most users who want a stable, performant desktop without the overhead of animations.
