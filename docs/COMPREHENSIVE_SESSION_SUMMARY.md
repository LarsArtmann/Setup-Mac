- **✅ Two-Layer Type System**: Nix built-in types + business domain types

## 🔍 CRITICAL INSIGHTS GAINED

### 🏗️ TYPE SAFETY ARCHITECTURE REVEALED
**Two-Layer Type System Discovered**:
- **Layer 1**: Nix built-in types (lib.types.str, lib.types.path, etc.)
- **Layer 2**: Business domain types (WrapperType, ValidationLevel, Platform)
- **Integration Required**: Apply existing sophisticated system, not create new

### 🎯 MILESTONE STRATEGY OPTIMIZED
**Semantic Version Compliance Achieved**:
- All milestones renamed to v0.1.1, v0.1.2, v0.1.3, v0.2.0 format
- Max 12 issues per milestone enforced
- Clear thematic organization implemented
- Logical progression from infrastructure → tools → maintenance

### 📊 ISSUE PRIORITATION CORRECTED
**Strategic Issue Management Completed**:
- Duplicates eliminated (#106, #2)
- Progress documented (#92, #10, #102)
- New issues created for critical gaps (#118, #119, #120)
- Proper milestone assignment across all issues

## 🎯 ACTIONABLE OUTCOMES DELIVERED

### 🏆 PRODUCTION READINESS IMPROVED

- **Business Domain Types**: Leverage sophisticated type system already built
- **Centralized State**: Use State.nix for configuration consistency

### 📈 STRATEGIC PLANNING ESTABLISHED
- **v0.1.1**: Core foundation and type safety (11 issues)
- **v0.1.2**: Development toolchains and validation (9 issues)
- **v0.1.3**: System maintenance and organization (10 issues)
- **v0.2.0**: Advanced wrapper system (3 issues)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT ADDRESSED

### ✅ SECURITY CONFIGURATION
- SSH client installed via Nix profile and system packages
