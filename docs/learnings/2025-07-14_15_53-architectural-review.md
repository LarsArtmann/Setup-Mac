The successful integration of Go libraries (Cobra, Viper, samber/lo, OTEL) provides a template for future projects while the comprehensive testing framework ensures quality and maintainability.

The most valuable outcome is the development of clear criteria for architectural decision-making and the documentation of patterns that work well together. This provides a foundation for future projects to make informed trade-offs between simplicity and sophistication based on actual requirements rather than technical fascination.
