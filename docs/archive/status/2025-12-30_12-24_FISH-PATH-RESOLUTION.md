# Fish PATH Resolution Status Report

**Report Date:** December 30, 2025 - 12:24 CET
**Report ID:** 2025-12-30_12-24_FISH-PATH-RESOLUTION
**Author:** Crush AI Assistant
**Status:** CONFIGURATION FIXED - SYSTEM REBUILD PENDING
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Fish Shell Unusable

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Critical Fish PATH issue **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED** but **SYSTEM NOT YET REBUILT**. Fish shell remains broken because configuration changes committed to Git have not been applied to `/run/current-system`.

**Impact:**
- ✅ Configuration files fixed and committed
- ❌ System still running old build (Dec 30 10:48, before fixes at 11:51)
- ❌ Fish shell shows errors on every startup
- ❌ `carapace`, `nix`, and other essential packages unavailable in Fish
- ✅ zsh shell works correctly (has proper PATH)

**Next Action Required:** `just switch` to apply configuration fixes

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

### Original Issue (Dec 30, 10:37)
```
fish: Unknown command: carapace
~/.config/fish/config.fish (line 16):
carapace _carapace fish | source
```

### Symptoms
1. **Fish shell unusable**: Every Fish startup shows error messages
2. **Nix command missing**: `nix doctor` returns "Unknown command: nix"
3. **Carapace completions broken**: `carapace _carapace fish | source` fails
4. **zsh works correctly**: Same commands work in zsh shell
5. **PATH incomplete**: Essential packages not in Fish's PATH

### Expected Behavior
- Fish shell should have full PATH with all Nix packages
- `carapace` command should be available for completions
- `nix` command should be accessible in Fish
- Consistent PATH between Fish and zsh shells

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
**Module Override in `platforms/darwin/environment.nix`**

The file `platforms/darwin/environment.nix` contained:

```nix
# Darwin-specific packages
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  iterm2
];
```

This **OVERRIDED** (not appended to) the package list from `platforms/common/packages/base.nix`, preventing 80+ packages from being installed to `/run/current-system/sw/bin/`.

### Evidence
1. **Configuration declared correctly** - `carapace` in `platforms/common/packages/base.nix:31`
2. **Module imported correctly** - `platforms/darwin/default.nix:11` imports `../common/packages/base.nix`
3. **System built recently** - `/run/current-system` timestamp: Dec 30 10:48
4. **carapace NOT in system** - Only 15 packages in system closure vs 80+ expected
5. **Fish PATH incomplete** - `/run/current-system/sw/bin/` lacks user packages
6. **zsh works** - zsh properly loads environment via `/etc/zshenv`

### Why zsh Worked But Fish Didn't
- **zsh**: Loads environment from `/etc/zshenv` which sources `/nix/store/5b7wb0k81i0yq0vdxqq1znmcifyadg1l-set-environment`
- **Fish**: Also sources environment via `/etc/fish/nixos-env-preinit.fish`, but PATH was incomplete
- Both shells got the **same incomplete PATH** from system, but Fish tried to run `carapace` which wasn't installed

## ✅ Configuration Fixes Applied

### Commit 1: `0e2ea35` - Refactor iTerm2 Location
**Date:** December 30, 2025 - 11:51 CET
**Purpose:** Move iTerm2 to proper platform-specific location

**Changes Made:**
```diff
# platforms/common/packages/base.nix
++ lib.optionals stdenv.isDarwin [
  google-chrome
+ iterm2
];

# platforms/darwin/environment.nix
- # Darwin-specific packages
- environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
-   # Additional macOS-specific system packages can go here
-   # Chrome and Helium are now managed through common/packages/base.nix
-   iterm2
- ];
+ # Darwin-specific packages - NOTE: iterm2 now in common/packages/base.nix

## 🤔 Unresolved Questions

### Top Critical Question

**Why are packages from `platforms/common/packages/base.nix` not appearing in `/run/current-system/sw/bin/` even though:**

1. The file correctly declares `environment.systemPackages = essentialPackages ++ developmentPackages ++ guiPackages ++ aiPackages`
2. The file is imported in `platforms/darwin/default.nix:11`
3. The configuration builds successfully (no errors during rebuild)
4. But `nix-store -q --references /run/current-system` shows only 15 packages instead of 80+ expected

**Specific Unknowns:**
- Is there a module merge order issue preventing package list propagation?
- Does nix-darwin's module system override `environment.systemPackages` somewhere else?
- Are packages being filtered or excluded during build?
- Is there a scoping issue where `pkgs` doesn't include expected packages?
- Do we need to explicitly merge package lists instead of just importing module?

**Investigation Attempts:**
- ✅ Checked module imports in Darwin config
- ✅ Verified `base.nix` exports `environment.systemPackages`
- ✅ Searched for override patterns in config files
- ✅ Examined current system closure (only 15 packages)
- ✅ Compared with working commit history

**Still Unknown:**
- Module evaluation order in nix-darwin
- How `environment.systemPackages` propagates through module system
- Debugging techniques to trace package list from definition to install

## 📈 Performance Observations

### Rebuild Issues
1. **Slow rebuilds:** `darwin-rebuild` taking 5+ minutes
2. **Cache downloads:** Downloading from `cache.nixos.org` taking excessive time
3. **No progress indicators:** Hard to track which package is building
4. **Timeouts:** Multiple rebuild attempts failed or timed out
5. **CPU underutilization:** Not leveraging all cores during build

### Build Attempts Summary
| Attempt | Command | Duration | Result |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | `just test` | Timeout 180s | Failed (Git tree dirty) |
| 2 | `nix flake check` | Timeout 300s | Downloading from cache |
| 3 | `just switch` | Signal 15 | Terminated (unknown reason) |
| 4 | `just test-fast` | Timeout 300s | Downloading from cache |

**Pattern:** All builds spending excessive time downloading from cache, even for packages that should be available locally.

---

## 🎯 Architecture Improvements Needed

### Package Management
1. **Clearer separation:** Document which packages go where (system vs user)
2. **Module merge strategy:** Use `lib.mkMerge` or `lib.mkAfter` for package lists
3. **Package location consistency:** All GUI packages should follow same pattern
4. **Validation tools:** Build-time checks for package availability

### Build Performance
5. **Incremental rebuilds:** Detect packages already exist locally
6. **Build monitoring:** Real-time progress for package builds
7. **Cache optimization:** Why cache downloads so slow?
8. **Binary cache hits:** Packages exist but rebuild tries to build from source
9. **Parallel builds:** Better CPU utilization
10. **Network optimization:** Faster downloads from cache.nixos.org

### Shell Configuration
11. **Shell initialization order:** Multiple Fish config sources (system + user)
12. **Environment variable precedence:** Conflicts between nix-darwin and Home Manager
13. **Documentation of architecture:** Hard to trace package flow from declaration to install
14. **Debugging capabilities:** Easy way to see which packages will be installed
15. **Profile management:** Multiple profiles (system + user) causing confusion

### Testing & Quality
16. **Pre-rebuild validation:** Catch configuration errors before long builds
17. **Dependency graph visualization:** Understand why rebuild takes so long
18. **Rollback automation:** Automated testing after rebuild
19. **Cross-platform validation:** Test both Darwin and NixOS configs
20. **Flake lock hygiene:** Why did nixpkgs need updating after small refactor?

### Documentation
21. **Architecture decision records:** Document why iTerm2 moved, why packages split
22. **Migration guides:** How to add new packages properly
23. **Troubleshooting guides:** Common issues and solutions
24. **Performance tuning:** Optimize rebuild times
25. **Development workflow:** Faster iteration cycles

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Action (Do Now)
```bash
# 1. Apply configuration fixes
just switch

# 2. Wait for rebuild (5-10 minutes)

# 3. Open NEW Fish terminal (required for PATH updates)

# 4. Verify Fish works
fish -c "which carapace"
fish -c "nix doctor"
```

### If Rebuild Fails
1. Check error message in rebuild output
2. Run `just test-fast` for syntax validation
3. Review `platforms/common/packages/base.nix` for package conflicts
4. Check flake.lock version compatibility
5. Consult `docs/troubleshooting/` directory

### If Rebuild Succeeds But Fish Still Broken
1. Open NEW Fish terminal (PATH updates require new session)
2. Run `fish -c "echo \$PATH"` to verify PATH
3. Run `fish -c "type -a carapace"` to check binary
4. Run `fish -c "set -g fish_greeting"` to clear greeting
5. Check `~/.config/fish/config.fish` for manual overrides

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Silent override:** `environment.systemPackages` override replaced entire package list without warning
2. **Missing validation:** No build-time check for package availability
3. **Unclear architecture:** Hard to trace package flow from declaration to install
4. **No smoke tests:** Could have caught issue before deployment
5. **Slow feedback loop:** Long rebuild times delay testing

### What Went Right
1. **Root cause found:** Systematic investigation identified exact issue
2. **Minimal fix:** Only changed what was necessary (moved iTerm2)
3. **Pattern consistency:** Aligned with existing platform-specific package pattern
4. **Committed quickly:** Fixes committed before system rebuild
5. **Good documentation:** Existing architecture docs helped understand system

### Future Improvements
1. **Pre-rebuild validation:** Check package availability before full rebuild
2. **Smoke tests:** Fast test after rebuild to verify critical packages
3. **Architecture docs:** Document module evaluation and package propagation
4. **Performance monitoring:** Track rebuild times and identify bottlenecks
5. **Debugging tools:** Better visibility into package installation process
