# 2025-12-10_09-09_CRITICAL_BUILD_FAILURE_ANALYSIS

**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL BUILD FAILURE**
**Issue:** Import path resolution failing during build
**Root Cause:** Complex module loading conflicts in Home Manager

---

## 🚨 ERROR ANALYSIS

### **Error Pattern Recognition**
- Two different failed paths with same error:
  1. `/nix/store/.../platforms/nixos/common/home.nix` - WRONG
  2. `/nix/store/.../platforms/common/home.nix` - RIGHT

- **Issue**: The build system is resolving paths inconsistently
- **Pattern**: Nix store hashing causing path resolution confusion

### **Current Import Chain (Broken)**
```
platforms/nixos/users/home.nix
→ ../../common/home.nix
❌ FAILS: Resolves to platforms/nixos/common/home.nix (WRONG)
```

### **Expected Import Chain (Correct)**
```
platforms/nixos/users/home.nix
→ ../../common/home.nix
✅ SHOULD RESOLVE TO: platforms/common/home.nix (CORRECT)
```

---

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC PLAN

### **1. PATH RESOLUTION DEBUGGING**
- Use `readlink -f` to verify actual file locations
- Check if `platforms/nixos/common/` directory exists (shouldn't)
- Verify `platforms/common/home.nix` exists and is correct

### **2. SIMPLIFIED IMPORT TEST**
- Test basic import without complex Home Manager modules
- Isolate the import path issue from module complexity

### **3. WORKING DIRECTORY VERIFICATION**
- Ensure we're in correct project root
- Verify `pwd` shows expected path
- Check for any conflicting directory structures

---

## 🎯 HYPOTHESIS

### **Primary Hypothesis**: Path Resolution Conflict
- Nix module resolution is following directory structure literally
- `../../common/home.nix` from `platforms/nixos/users/` should resolve correctly
- But build system may be using cached or incorrect path resolution

### **Secondary Hypothesis**: Directory Structure Corruption
- `platforms/nixos/common/` directory may exist when it shouldn't
- This would cause `../../common/` to resolve incorrectly

### **Tertiary Hypothesis**: Nix Store Hashing Issue
- Multiple builds with different paths causing store hash conflicts
- Need to clean build cache and retry

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS

### **Step 1: Directory Structure Verification**
```bash
# Verify current working directory
pwd

# Check for incorrect directory existence
ls -la platforms/nixos/

# Verify correct target exists
ls -la platforms/common/

# Test path resolution manually
cd platforms/nixos/users/ && ls ../../common/
```

### **Step 2: Clean Build Environment**
```bash
# Clean Nix store cache
nix store_gc

# Remove any existing build artifacts
rm -rf result/

# Fresh build attempt
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.evo-x2.config.system.build.toplevel
```

### **Step 3: Minimal Import Test**
```bash
# Test with simple import chain
# Remove hyprland.nix import temporarily
# Test only common/home.nix import
```

## 📊 IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### **Current Blockers**
- **High**: Cannot build NixOS configuration
- **High**: Import path resolution failing consistently
- **Medium**: Need to debug complex Nix module loading

### **Workarounds Available**
- Try absolute imports (not ideal but functional)
- Temporarily inline common configuration
- Use simpler relative import structure

---

## 🔍 DEBUGGING STRATEGY

### **1. Isolate the Issue**
- Test import without Home Manager complexity
- Remove all imports except the failing one
- Gradually add back imports to identify conflict

### **2. Alternative Import Methods**
- Test absolute path imports: `../../../platforms/common/home.nix`
- Test import via flake structure
- Test inline configuration (no imports)

### **3. Environment Verification**
- Check for multiple platform directories
- Verify no symbolic links causing confusion
- Check for duplicate file structures

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

### **Immediate Goal**: Build Success
- `nix build` completes without import errors
- All modules load correctly
- Path resolution works as expected

### **Secondary Goal**: Understanding Root Cause
- Identify why path resolution fails
- Document the fix for future reference
- Prevent similar issues in reorganization

## 🚨 CRITICAL STATUS ASSESSMENT

**MISSION STATUS**: 🔴 **BLOCKED BY BUILD FAILURE**

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: 🔧 **RESOLVE IMPORT PATH DISASTER**

**NEXT PHASE**: 🎯 **DIAGNOSTIC DEBUGGING**

**CONFIDENCE**: HIGH - Issue identified, systematic debugging approach ready
