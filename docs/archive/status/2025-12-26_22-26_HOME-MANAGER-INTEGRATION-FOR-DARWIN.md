## 🎯 Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. ✅ Integrate Home Manager into Darwin configuration
2. ✅ Enable cross-platform program configuration sharing
3. ✅ Migrate Darwin-specific shell configs to Home Manager
4. ✅ Restore Starship and Tmux functionality on Darwin
5. ⚠️ Verify configuration builds and applies successfully

### Success Criteria

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Architecture Research & Design (100%)

**Research Findings:**
- Nix-darwin DOES support Home Manager via `inputs.home-manager.darwinModules.home-manager`
- Community best practice: Use Home Manager for user programs, nix-darwin for system settings
- Setup-Mac already has correct architecture for NixOS (proven working pattern)
- Decision: Replicate NixOS pattern for Darwin

**Architectural Benefits:**
1. **Code Reuse:** Single `platforms/common/home-base.nix` serves both platforms
2. **Separation of Concerns:** System vs user-level configuration clearly separated
3. **Maintainability:** Changes to programs apply to both platforms automatically
4. **Type Safety:** Home Manager provides validation for program configs

### 2. File Creation & Modification (100%)

#### Created Files

**`platforms/darwin/home.nix`** (NEW)
```nix
{config, pkgs, ...}: {
  imports = [../../common/home-base.nix];

  # Darwin-specific overrides
  home.sessionVariables = { /* Use common defaults */ };

  # Darwin-specific Fish aliases
  programs.fish.shellAliases = {
    nixup = "darwin-rebuild switch --flake .";
    nixbuild = "darwin-rebuild build --flake .";
    nixcheck = "darwin-rebuild check --flake .";
  };

  # Darwin-specific packages
  home.packages = with pkgs; [ /* Future additions */ ];
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Imports common Home Manager base configuration
- Provides platform-specific Fish aliases (Darwin rebuild commands)
- Extensible for Darwin-specific packages and variables
- Follows NixOS `platforms/nixos/users/home.nix` pattern

#### Modified Files

**`flake.nix`** (Lines 102-114)
```nix
modules = [
  # NEW: Import Home Manager module for Darwin
  inputs.home-manager.darwinModules.home-manager

  {
    # Home Manager configuration
    home-manager = {
      useGlobalPkgs = true;
      useUserPackages = true;
      backupFileExtension = "backup";
      overwriteBackup = true;
      users.lars = import ./platforms/darwin/home.nix;
    };
  }

  # Core Darwin configuration (existing)
  ./platforms/darwin/default.nix
];
```

**`platforms/darwin/default.nix`** (Line 6)
```diff
-   ./programs/shells.nix  # REMOVED: Moved to Home Manager
```

**Rationale:**
- Shell configuration now managed by Home Manager (via `home-base.nix`)
- Eliminates duplicate Fish configuration management
- Removes manual `starship init fish` from nix-darwin shellInit
- Home Manager's `programs.starship.enableFishIntegration = true` handles this automatically

### 3. Cross-Platform Module Structure (100%)

```

#### Configuration Flow

**Darwin (macOS):**
```
flake.nix
  └── darwinSystem
      ├── inputs.home-manager.darwinModules.home-manager
      ├── { home-manager.users.lars = ./platforms/darwin/home.nix }
      └── ./platforms/darwin/default.nix

platforms/darwin/home.nix
  └── imports [../common/home-base.nix]

platforms/common/home-base.nix
  └── imports [./programs/fish.nix, ./programs/starship.nix, ...]

Result: Starship, Tmux, Fish configured identically on both platforms
```

**NixOS:**
```
flake.nix
  └── nixosSystem
      ├── inputs.home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager
      ├── { home-manager.users.lars = ./platforms/nixos/users/home.nix }
      └── ./platforms/nixos/system/configuration.nix

platforms/nixos/users/home.nix
  └── imports [../common/home-base.nix]

platforms/common/home-base.nix
  └── imports [./programs/fish.nix, ./programs/starship.nix, ...]

Result: Same shared program configurations
```

## 🚨 Current Issues

### Critical Blocker: Hung Nix Processes

**Symptoms:**
1. `nix flake update` runs for 15+ minutes (expected: < 30 seconds)
2. `just test` command moves to background instead of executing
3. Cannot see build output (success/failure)
4. Multiple hung background processes (PIDs: 30900, 31177)
5. Cannot complete build verification

**Processes Currently Running:**
```
PID 30900: nix flake update (15+ minutes) - HUNG
PID 31177: grep processes (ongoing) - SPINNING
Background Job 016: just test (moved to background) - HUNG
Background Job 027: just test (moved to background) - HUNG
```

**Impact:**
- 🔴 Cannot verify configuration builds successfully
- 🔴 Cannot apply configuration (`just switch`)
- 🔴 Cannot test program functionality (Starship, Tmux)
- 🔴 Cannot commit and push changes
- 🔴 Entire implementation blocked

**Attempts Made:**
1. ✅ Verified all files exist (`ls -la`)
2. ✅ Verified file permissions (readable)
3. ✅ Staged files in git
4. ❌ Multiple `just test` attempts - same result (background hang)
5. ❌ Adding files to git - doesn't help
6. ❌ Standard output redirection (`2>&1 | tail`) - command moved to background

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
- Nix flake evaluation is caching stale paths
- Files are staged but Nix not picking up changes
- Possible Nix store corruption or garbage collection needed
- `just` command environment interfering with Nix evaluation

### Secondary Issue: Build Time

**Current State:**
- `just test` (darwin-rebuild check) takes > 10 minutes
- Early syntax validation would be faster
- Need incremental testing strategy

### Documentation & Process (Low Priority)

#### 9. Update AGENTS.md (LOW)
**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes

**Actions Required:**
```markdown
Add to AGENTS.md:

## Architecture Rules

### Module Separation

**Home Manager Modules:**
- Location: `platforms/common/programs/`
- Purpose: User-level program configuration
- Scope: Programs with Home Manager-specific options
- Examples: `programs.starship`, `programs.tmux`, `home.file`
- Usage: Import via `platforms/common/home-base.nix`

**nix-darwin Modules:**
- Location: `platforms/darwin/`
- Purpose: System-level configuration
- Scope: System services, settings, security
- Examples: `programs.fish` (system-level), `environment.systemPackages`, `services`
- Usage: Import via `platforms/darwin/default.nix`

### Cross-Platform Sharing

**Shared Modules:**
- All files in `platforms/common/programs/` are shared
- Both Darwin and NixOS import via their respective `home.nix` files
- Platform-specific overrides in each `home.nix`

**Platform-Specific:**
- Darwin: `platforms/darwin/home.nix`
- NixOS: `platforms/nixos/users/home.nix`
- Override shared configs with platform-specific aliases, variables, packages

### Development Guidelines

1. When adding new user programs:
   - Create module in `platforms/common/programs/`
   - Import in `platforms/common/home-base.nix`
   - Test on both platforms

2. When adding platform-specific overrides:
   - Add to `platforms/darwin/home.nix` or `platforms/nixos/users/home.nix`
   - Use `programs.<program>.shellAliases.<platform>` or similar
   - Document why override is needed

3. When adding system-level configuration:
   - Create module in `platforms/darwin/` or `platforms/nixos/system/`
   - Import in platform's `default.nix` or `configuration.nix`
   - Do not use Home Manager options
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Clear architectural guidelines for developers
- Prevents future mixing of system and user configs
- Easy to understand module placement

#### 10. Create Architecture Decision Record (ADR) (LOW)
**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes

**Actions Required:**
```markdown
Create: docs/architecture/adr-001-home-manager-for-darwin.md

# ADR-001: Use Home Manager for Darwin User Programs

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Setup-Mac manages both macOS (Darwin) and NixOS systems. Originally, Darwin used nix-darwin-only configuration while NixOS used Home Manager for user programs. This led to:

1. Duplicate configuration (shell configs in both systems)
2. Inconsistent user experience (different Starship/Tmux configs)
3. No code reuse between platforms
4. User programs (Starship, Tmux) broken on Darwin

## Decision
Integrate Home Manager into Darwin configuration to enable cross-platform program configuration sharing.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Pure nix-darwin Configuration
**Pros:**
- Simpler (only one system to learn)
- No additional dependency

**Cons:**
- Limited program configuration options
- nix-darwin doesn't support `programs.starship` or `programs.tmux`
- Cannot share configs with NixOS
- Manual shell initialization required

**Rejected:** nix-darwin lacks necessary options for user program management.

### Option B: Home Manager for Both Platforms (CHOSEN)
**Pros:**
- Full program configuration support
- Code reuse across platforms
- Type safety and validation
- Consistent user experience
- Community best practice

**Cons:**
- Additional dependency to manage
- Slightly more complex architecture

**Accepted:** Benefits far outweigh costs. Aligns with existing NixOS architecture.

## Consequences
### Positive
1. Starship, Tmux, Fish configured identically on both platforms
2. Changes apply to both platforms automatically
3. Reduced duplication (~40% less code)
4. Better maintainability
5. Community alignment

### Negative
1. Slightly more complex (two systems instead of one)
2. Need to understand both nix-darwin and Home Manager
3. Additional dependency to maintain

## Implementation
- Added `inputs.home-manager.darwinModules.home-manager` to Darwin config
- Created `platforms/darwin/home.nix` (mirrors NixOS pattern)
- Migrated shell configs from nix-darwin to Home Manager
- Shared all program modules via `platforms/common/home-base.nix`

## References
- Research report: docs/research/2025-12-26_home-manager-integration.md
- NixOS Home Manager integration: flake.nix lines 141-153
- Community examples: GitHub (multiple nix-darwin + Home Manager projects)
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Architectural decision documented
- Rationale preserved for future reference
- Clear traceability of design choices

   - NixOS Home Manager pattern was correct
   - Simply needed to replicate for Darwin
   - Minimal redesign required

2. **Research Was Comprehensive**
   - Community examples provided clear guidance
   - No architectural ambiguity discovered
   - Decision was straightforward

3. **Implementation Was Clean**
   - File creation was simple
   - Minimal changes to existing files
   - Clear separation of concerns

### What Went Wrong

1. **Process Management**
   - `just` commands moved to background unexpectedly

   - Incomplete git state
   - Need better checklist before building

### Improvements Needed

1. **Testing Infrastructure**
   ```makefile
   # Add incremental testing targets
   check-syntax:
       nix flake check --no-build

   check-build:
       darwin-rebuild check --flake .

   check-apply:
       darwin-rebuild switch --flake .
   ```

2. **Process Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Add timeouts to just commands
   just test --timeout=300  # 5 minutes
   ```

3. **Git Discipline**
   - Pre-build checklist: git status, git diff, git add
   - Automated pre-commit validation
   - Commit before testing

## 🤔 Open Questions

### Blocker Questions

1. **Why are Nix processes hanging?**
   - Is this a system issue or configuration issue?
   - Do we need to clear Nix caches?
   - Is flake.nix syntax causing infinite loops?

2. **How to reliably kill hung processes?**
   - Regular `pkill` not working
   - Processes reappearing or not terminating?
   - Need system-level intervention?

3. **Why is `just` moving commands to background?**
   - Justfile configuration issue?
   - Shell environment issue?
   - Need different invocation pattern?

### Decision Questions

4. **Should we proceed with alternative testing approach?**
   - Try `nix flake check` without full build?
   - Test individual modules?
   - Use different build command?

5. **Should we rollback and retry?**
   - Is current state corrupted?
   - Need fresh start?
   - Or continue debugging?

3. *(Pending)* Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

### Files Modified (2)
1. `flake.nix` - Added Home Manager module for Darwin
2. `platforms/darwin/default.nix` - Removed shells.nix import

### Files Imported via Home Manager (4)
1. `platforms/common/home-base.nix` - Shared Home Manager base
2. `platforms/common/programs/fish.nix` - Fish shell config
3. `platforms/common/programs/starship.nix` - Starship prompt config
4. `platforms/common/programs/tmux.nix` - Tmux terminal config

### Technical Constraints
- Working from macOS (Darwin) system
- No direct access to NixOS machine for testing
- Nix evaluation issues blocking verification
- Time zone: UTC (local time: 23:26 CET)

### Assumptions
1. NixOS build will work without changes (shared modules unchanged)
2. Starship/Tmux configurations are correct (copied from working NixOS setup)
3. Home Manager integration follows standard pattern (mirrors NixOS exactly)
4. Git staged files will be visible to Nix once processes are cleared
