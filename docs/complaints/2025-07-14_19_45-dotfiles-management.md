# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

I was asked to perform:
Comprehensive architectural review and improvement of the Setup-Mac dotfiles repository, including GitHub issue management, architecture analysis, and implementation of advanced patterns like DDD, CQRS, and Railway-Oriented Programming.

I was given these context information's:
- Access to complete Setup-Mac dotfiles repository
- Instructions to implement sophisticated Go patterns (gin, viper, templ, HTMX, samber/*, sqlc, watermill)
- Guidance on Event-Sourcing, Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, and advanced architectural patterns
- Direction to focus on customer value and type safety
- Request to investigate ghost systems and integration issues

I was missing these information:
1. **Project Type Clarification**: Initially unclear that this is a personal dotfiles repository, not a complex application requiring sophisticated architectural patterns
2. **Scope Appropriateness**: No guidance on when advanced patterns (DDD, Event Sourcing, CQRS) are overkill for simple use cases
3. **Customer Definition**: For personal dotfiles, "customer value" means personal productivity, not business metrics
4. **Complexity Justification Framework**: Missing criteria for when to apply enterprise patterns vs. simple solutions

I was confused by:
1. **Architecture Mismatch**: Requests to implement complex Go web frameworks (gin, HTMX) for dotfiles management seemed incongruous
2. **Over-Engineering Direction**: Instructions to implement Event Sourcing and CQRS for configuration management appeared excessive
3. **Library Integration Emphasis**: Focus on advanced libraries when simple shell scripts are more appropriate for dotfiles
4. **Application vs. Tools Confusion**: Treating dotfiles management as if it were a complex business application

What I wish for the future is:
1. **Project Context First**: Clear identification of project type (application vs. dotfiles vs. library) before architectural recommendations
2. **Complexity Appropriateness Guidelines**: Framework for matching architectural sophistication to actual requirements
3. **Pragmatic Value Assessment**: Clear definition of what constitutes value for different types of projects
4. **Simplicity First Principle**: Default to simple solutions unless complexity is clearly justified
5. **Use Case Validation**: Verify that proposed patterns actually solve real problems in the specific context
