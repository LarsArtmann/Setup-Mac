# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: 2025-07-14T09:04:25+02:00

I was asked to perform:
Create comprehensive documentation files for Claude configuration modernization including:
- A complaint report about missing/confusing information (12min)
- A learnings document from this chat session (12min)
- A reusable prompt for future use (8min)
- List all existing files in learnings/ folder (3min)
- Verify numbering and no duplicates (5min)

I was given these context information's:
- Working directory: /Users/larsartmann/Desktop/Setup-Mac/
- Git repository with recent commits about Claude configuration improvements
- Specific file location templates and naming conventions
- Template structure for complaint report
- Instruction to analyze learnings from DDD/Event Sourcing implementation
- Context about architecture decisions, library integrations, and performance optimizations
- Access to existing documentation structure with previous analysis from 2025-07-13

I was missing these information:
1. **Specific chat session context**: I was asked to document learnings "from this chat session" but no specific conversation history or context was provided about what Claude configuration modernization work was actually performed
2. **Library integration details**: While asked to document learnings about cobra, viper, samber/lo, OTEL integrations, no specific details about how these were implemented or what challenges were encountered
3. **Performance metrics**: Asked to document "performance optimization learnings" but no specific benchmarks, before/after measurements, or optimization techniques were provided
4. **Testing framework context**: Requested to include "testing framework insights (godog, testify)" but no information about actual test implementations or challenges
5. **Architecture decision rationale**: While asked to document architecture decisions and consequences, no specific decisions or their outcomes were provided
6. **Ghost system specifics**: Asked to include "Ghost system identification and resolution" but no details about what ghost systems were found or how they were resolved

I was confused by:
1. **Scope ambiguity**: The task asks for documentation "from this chat session" but we're at the beginning of the session with no prior context about modernization work
2. **Contradiction with preferences**: My instructions say "NEVER proactively create documentation files" but this task explicitly requests creating multiple documentation files
3. **Time allocation specificity**: Very precise time estimates (12min, 8min, 3min) without clear calibration of what constitutes each time unit
4. **Template vs. reality mismatch**: The complaint template suggests documenting actual work performed, but we're creating documentation before the work has been done
5. **Learning documentation timing**: Asked to document learnings from a session that hasn't occurred yet

What I wish for the future is:
1. **Clear session boundaries**: When asked to document "this chat session", provide clear definition of which session/conversation is being referenced
2. **Context-first approach**: Provide relevant background about what work was performed before asking for documentation of that work
3. **Actual implementation details**: Include specific code examples, performance metrics, and technical decisions when asking for technical documentation
4. **Progressive documentation**: Consider documenting learnings incrementally as work progresses rather than retroactively
5. **Tool integration evidence**: When documenting library integrations, provide actual implementation examples or configuration files
6. **Measurable outcomes**: Include specific metrics, benchmarks, or quantifiable results when documenting optimization work
7. **Clear documentation purpose**: Specify whether documentation is for future reference, knowledge sharing, or project handoff to guide appropriate detail level

Overall Assessment:
This appears to be a request to create documentation structure and templates for future modernization work rather than documenting completed work. The request would be clearer if framed as "create documentation templates for Claude configuration modernization" rather than "document learnings from this session."
