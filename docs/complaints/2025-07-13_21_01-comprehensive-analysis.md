# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: 2025-07-13T21:01:25+02:00

I was asked to perform:
Comprehensive analysis and improvement of the Setup-Mac repository including:
- Ghost system identification and cleanup
- GitHub issue management and implementation
- Architecture analysis and documentation creation
- Creation of execution plans with specific time estimates
- Documentation of learnings and creation of reusable prompts
- Architecture diagram creation

I was given these context information's:
- Access to complete Setup-Mac repository with Nix configuration
- Global Claude configuration in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- Git repository status and history
- Full access to all files including better-claude-go project
- GitHub CLI access for issue management

I was missing these information:
1. **Clear prioritization framework**: While asked to sort by "importance/impact/effort/customer-value", the specific weighting or scoring methodology wasn't defined
2. **Definition of "customer value"**: For a personal setup repository, it's unclear what constitutes customer value vs. personal productivity value
3. **Scope boundaries**: Whether to focus on immediate wins vs. long-term architectural improvements
4. **Risk tolerance**: No guidance on which changes require user approval vs. can be implemented autonomously
5. **Performance baselines**: While shell performance was mentioned, no specific performance targets were provided

I was confused by:
1. **Contradictory requests**: Asked to "NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary" but then asked to create comprehensive documentation structure
2. **Tool preference ambiguity**: User prefers `trash` over `rm` but this wasn't initially clear from context
3. **Claude tool choice**: Three different Claude implementations exist (shell script, Go binary, Go project) without clear guidance on which to prioritize
4. **Time estimation precision**: Asked for very specific time estimates (12min, 30-100min) but without clear calibration methodology

What I wish for the future is:
1. **Clear decision framework**: Explicit criteria for prioritization and autonomous decision-making boundaries
2. **Performance targets**: Specific benchmarks for what constitutes "good enough" vs. "needs improvement"
3. **Tool preferences documentation**: Clear preference hierarchy for tools and approaches
4. **Risk assessment guidance**: Framework for determining when to ask vs. proceed with changes
5. **Customer value definition**: For personal projects, clarify what drives value assessment
6. **Scope creep management**: Better boundaries between analysis, documentation, and implementation phases

Overall Assessment:
The request was comprehensive and well-structured, but would benefit from clearer decision-making frameworks and scope boundaries. The analysis uncovered significant architectural insights and practical improvements, demonstrating the value of the comprehensive approach.
