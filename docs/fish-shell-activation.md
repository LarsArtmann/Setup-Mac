# Fish Shell Activation Status

## Current Status
- **Current Default Shell:** ZSH (708ms startup)
- **Fish Shell Available:** ✅ v4.0.2 at `/run/current-system/sw/bin/fish`
- **Fish in /etc/shells:** ✅ Listed
- **Performance Gap:** 66x slower than possible (708ms vs 10.73ms)

## Manual Activation Required
Fish shell is installed and ready but requires manual activation:

```bash
chsh -s /run/current-system/sw/bin/fish
```

## Why Manual Step Needed
Nix can install Fish but cannot set it as default shell without user interaction for security reasons.

## Impact of Activation
- **Performance:** 708ms → 10.73ms (66x improvement)
- **Features:** Better autosuggestions, syntax highlighting
- **Completions:** 1000+ commands via Carapace
- **Prompt:** Starship integration ready

## Configuration Ready
Fish configuration already deployed in:
- `/Users/larsartmann/.config/fish/config.fish`
- Carapace completions configured
- Starship prompt integration ready
- Performance optimizations applied

## Next Steps
1. Run `chsh -s /run/current-system/sw/bin/fish`
2. Open new terminal to test
3. Verify performance with `./shell-performance-benchmark.sh`
