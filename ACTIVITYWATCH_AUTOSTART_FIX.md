# ActivityWatch Auto-Start Fix

## Problem Identified
ActivityWatch was installed but had no auto-start mechanism configured.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Launch Agent (Primary)
Created `/Users/larsartmann/Library/LaunchAgents/net.activitywatch.ActivityWatch.plist`:
- Loads ActivityWatch at user login
- Runs in background mode
- Auto-restarts if it crashes
- Logs to `/tmp/net.activitywatch.ActivityWatch.*.log`

### 2. Login Item (Backup)
Added ActivityWatch to macOS login items via AppleScript:
- Ensures compatibility with standard macOS startup
- Provides visual feedback during startup
- Serves as backup mechanism

### 3. Dual Redundancy
Both mechanisms ensure ActivityWatch starts reliably:
- Launch agent: System-level, more robust
- Login item: User-level, standard macOS behavior

## Verification Status
✅ ActivityWatch installed at `/Applications/ActivityWatch.app`
✅ Launch agent loaded and active
✅ Login item added to System Preferences
✅ Process running: 5 components (server, watchers, etc.)
✅ Web interface accessible on port 5600
✅ Auto-restart configured for crash recovery

## Test Results
- Manual start: ✅ Working
- Launch agent start: ✅ Working
- Login item start: ✅ Working
- Port 5600 listening: ✅ Confirmed
- Web interface: ✅ Available at http://localhost:5600

## Files Created/Modified
- `/Users/larsartmann/Library/LaunchAgents/net.activitywatch.ActivityWatch.plist` (NEW)
- macOS Login Items (UPDATED via AppleScript)

ActivityWatch will now automatically start on every login and restart if it crashes.
